### What's [AWS SDK for pandas](https://aws-sdk-pandas.readthedocs.io/en/stable/about.html)?

An AWS Professional Service open source python initiative that extends the power of the pandas library to AWS, connecting DataFrames and AWS data & analytics services.

Easy integration with Athena, Glue, Redshift, Timestream, OpenSearch, Neptune, QuickSight, Chime, CloudWatchLogs, DynamoDB, EMR, SecretManager, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLServer and S3 (Parquet, CSV, JSON and EXCEL).

Built on top of other open-source projects like Pandas, Apache Arrow and Boto3, it offers abstracted functions to execute your usual ETL tasks like load/unloading data from Data Lakes, Data Warehouses and Databases, even at scale.
